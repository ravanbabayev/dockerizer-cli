2. Extract the archive
3. Add the binary to your PATH

## Usage

Simply navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
dockerizer init
```

The tool will:
1. Analyze your project structure
2. Detect the programming language and framework
3. Ask for confirmation or alternative selection
4. Offer database integration options
5. Generate optimized Docker files

## Example

```bash
$ cd my-project
$ dockerizer init

✔ Detected Node.js as the project language. Is this correct? [Y/n] y
✔ Detected React as the framework. Is this correct? [Y/n] y
✔ Default port for React is 3000. Would you like to use a different port? [y/N] n
✔ Does your project need a database? [Y/n] y
✔ Select database type: PostgreSQL
✔ Default port for PostgreSQL is 5432. Would you like to use a different port? [y/N] n
